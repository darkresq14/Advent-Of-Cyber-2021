## Steps

1. Run *oledump.py* on the suspicious .doc file  
  `oledump.py <filepath>`
2. Select the macro stream number 8 and dump the contents  
  `oledump.py -s 8 -d`  
3. The decimal number 35 will be our **XOR** key, build the recipe in CyberChef using:  
   1. From Base64
   2. XOR 35 (Decimal from dropdown)
   3. From Base64

## What have we learned?

- CyberChef
- According to *Mozilla*, "Base64 encoding schemes are commonly used when there is a need to encode binary data that needs to be stored and transferred over media that are designed to deal with ASCII." 
- Another noteworthy cipher that attackers commonly use, and what we'll focus on, is the XOR (Exclusive Or (XOR)) cipher.
- **Oledump** (oledump.py - https://blog.didierstevens.com/programs/oledump-py/) is an excellent tool written in Python by Didier Stevens, which helps you analyze OLE (Compound File Binary Format) files. You can think of OLE files as 'a mini file system' or similar to a Zip archive. Applications such as MS Office with extensions .doc, .xls, .ppt are known as OLE files. Malicious actors can abuse macros to hide malicious commands/scripts within Excel and Word documents.
  - The **M** letter next to a stream indicates that the stream contains a VBA Macro
  - Options:
    - `-A` ASCII dump
    - `-S` dumps strings
    - `-d` produces a new dump of the stream content
    - `-s <STREAM NUMBER>` or `--select=<STREAM NUMBER>` allows you to select the stream number to analyze
    - `-d` or `--dump` perform a raw dump
    - `-x` or `--hexdump` - perform a hex dump
    - `-a` or `--asciidump` - perform an ascii dump
    - `-S` or `--strings` - perform a strings dump
    - `-v` or `--vbadecompress` - VBA decompression
