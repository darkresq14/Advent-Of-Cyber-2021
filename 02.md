## What have we learned?

- HTTP(S)
  - **= Hypertext Transfer Protocol**
  - client-server protocol to provide communication between a client and a webserver
  - HTTP requests are similar to a standard TCP network request; however, HTTP adds specific headers to the request to identify the protocol and other information
  - Example Request
  
    >GET / HTTP/1.1  
    Host: tryhackme.com  
    User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 Firefox/87.0  
    Referer: https://tryhackme.com/  

  - Example Response
    > HTTP/1.1 200 OK  
    Server: nginx/1.15.8  
    Date: Wednesday, 24 Nov 2021 13:34:03 GMT  
    Content-Type: text/html  
    Content-Length: 98  
    `<html>`
    `<head>`  
    `<title>Advent of Cyber</title>`  
    `</head>`  
    `<body>`  
    `Welcome To Advent of Cyber!`  
    `</body>`  
    `</html>`  

  - Web applications are commonly formatted in HTML (**HyperText Markup Language**), rendered, and styled in CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). JavaScript is also commonly used to provide additional functionality

- Cookies
  - HTTP is a stateless protocol. When you send requests to a web server, the server cannot distinguish your request from someone else's request.. To solve the stateless problem and identify different users and access levels, the webserver will assign cookies to create and manage a stateful session between client and server.
  - Cookies are tiny pieces of data (metadata) or information locally stored on your computer that are sent to the server when you make a request.
  - Cookies can be assigned any name and any value allowing the webserver to store any information it wants. Today we will be focusing on authentication cookies, also known as session cookies. Authentication or session cookies are used to identify you and what access level is attached to your session.

  | Component | Purpose | Example |
  | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
  | Name | Unique cookie identifier (arbitrarily set by web-server). Always paired with the value component. | SessionID |
  | Value | Unique cookie value (arbitrarily set by web-server). Always paired with the name component | sty1z3kz11mpqxjv648mqwlx4ginpt6c |
  | Domain | Originating domain of the cookie. Sets the scope of the cookie. | .tryhackme.com |
  | Path | Local path to cookie. Sets the scope of the cookie. | / |
  | Expires/Max-age | Date/time at which cookies expires | 2022-11-11T15:39:04.166Z |
  | Size | Disk size of the cookie in bytes. This is typically {Name+Value} |  91|
  | HttpOnly | Cookie cannot be accessed through client-side scripts | (indicated by a checkmark) |
  | Secure | Cookie is only sent over HTTPS | (indicated by a checkmark) |
  | SameSite | Specifies when a cookie is sent through cross-site requests | none |
  | SameParty | Extends functionality of SameSite attribute to First-Party sets.  | (indicated by a checkmark) |
  | Priority | Defines the importance of a cookie. Determines whether it should be removed or held on to | High |

  - `Set-Cookie: <cookie-name>=<cookie-value>; Domain=<domain-value>; Secure; HttpOnly`
  - Below is a summary of how cookie values could be manipulated.

    1. Obtain a cookie value from registering or signing up for an account.
    2. Decode the cookie value.
    3. Identify the object notation or structure of the cookie.
    4. Change the parameters inside the object to a different parameter with a higher privilege level, such as admin or administrator.
    5. Re-encode the cookie and insert the cookie into the value space; this can be done by double-clicking the value box.
    6. Action the cookie; this can be done by refreshing the page or logging in.
