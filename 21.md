## What have we learned?

- What are Yara rules
  - YARA is a multi-platform tool for matching patterns of interest in (malicious) files. It was created by Victor Alvarez from VirusTotal. It is used to perform research on malware families and identify malware with similar patterns. It can help in categorizing malware in different malware families, and can also be used as a detection aid for malware analysis. 
  - Yara rules are very widely used in the industry for the above-mentioned purposes. There are various open-source repositories of Yara rules shared by different organizations and people that can be leveraged by the security community in their fight against malware. This GitHub (https://github.com/InQuest/awesome-yara) repository contains links to a lot of such open-source repositories.
- What is the basic structure of Yara rules
```
rule rulename  
  {  
    meta:  
      author = "tryhackme"  
      description = "test rule"  
      created = "11/12/2021 00:00"  
    strings:  
      $textstring = "text"  
      $hexstring = {4D 5A}  
    conditions:  
  $textstring and $hexstring  
  }
  ```

- How Yara rules are used
  - Options:
    - `-m` to return the metadata when the rule is a hit 
    - `-s` to print the strings that matched the file
    - `-n` print only rules that did not hit
