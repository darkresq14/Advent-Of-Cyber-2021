## What have we learned?

- IDOR Vulnerability 
  - **= Insecure Direct Object Reference**
  - a type of access control vulnerability, when an attacker can gain access to information or actions not intended for them
  - can occur when a web server receives user-supplied input to retrieve objects (files, data, documents), and too much trust has been placed on that input data, and the web application does not validate whether the user should, in fact, have access to the requested object
- This user-supplied data can mainly be found in the following three places:
  - Query Component of the URL
  - Post Variables
  - Cookies
